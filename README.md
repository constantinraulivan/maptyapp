# Mapty App

It is a web application that helps you keep track of the routes you have taken on a map. These routes can be both for running and cycling, with the distance and duration of the route being recorded in both cases.

# The purpose of the application in the learning process

In this application, I have learned a great deal about APIs and how to utilize them, with a particular focus on the Geolocation API. Additionally, I have gained a deeper understanding of advanced DOM manipulation techniques and worked with Local Storage.
